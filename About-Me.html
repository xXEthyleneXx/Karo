                <p class="u-align-center u-custom-font u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-2">Hello my name is Devon Edwards&nbsp; I was born in 2003.&nbsp; When Turned 15 my aunt got me my first computer that started my path to now, and it was a Dell Insprion 15 3000 laptop at the time was a really good computer did my daily routine of playing Robocraft and Minecraft (Every Kid in the 2010s). Not long after me playing on peoples MInecraft server did it spike my interest in how does this work. So i set out on Youtube to figure it out ( YouTube is my main knowledge source at this time ) Finally i found a video on how to setup a Minecraft server my goals were satisfied. Until I got a group of my friends in a Discord call wanting them to join and play on it but for some reason they could not join no matter how many times they typed in the ip. I gave up for a little while about 2 years until I discovered a vide on port-forwarding (The ability to route traffic from the outside world into your sub-net to a specified computer running the server) I had to do it I figured out my problem. For about too weeks I began googling how to get into your router to open the 25565 port, turns out my parents are not tech savvy and they dident change the default login to our router soooo i kinda upend the port little did I know I just opened a whole mess of trouble with d-dosing (Distrusted Denial Of Service Attack) I got hit off a couple of times because i released my server on a public website :( had to get my ip changed the whole works I learned my lesson. About a year later I had discovered a branch of the server.jar called paper it allowed the creation of plugins into the server for user experience like the ability to fly and not be kicked all the works it thought it was amazing so i started up another server but at this time I had acquired my uncles old desktop and installed Linux Mint on it one of the easiest operating systems if you know what you are doing ( I Didn't ) but so it began Osbeorn 1.0 A factions Minecraft server like sarin now that allowed all players of all types into a faction based server amazing right, mind you this server was hosted on my uncles old dell desktop running Linux Mint we had just moved to the new house im currently living at but our other house still belonged to us and had a security system that required wifi to operate sooooo one night when my granddad came to get me I brought the old computer with me and set it up over there :) Not my house i cant be it off right? No not the case at all when you open a server to people that can get a cracked Minecraft account because they are to cheap to buy one what makes you think they don't know a little bit of information floating around the web. about too weeks into creating Osbeorn 1.0 windows released an update that added this thing called a Game Bar that had a option called Find A Group Of course I put out a thing saying I need people Experienced who can help me create and manage the Minecraft server and at 2am so did Alexander and Jonas the 3 Owners of Osbeorn Hosting (What Osbeorn Turned into) mind&nbsp; you we have changed a lot we all had interests in Minecraft because it was a huge deal at the time and everyone was playing it but they soon passed as does everything else I turned to coding as I just took 4 classes on tech in High School the first one called FOC (fundamentals of computing) that really helped me with navigation and introduced me to all kinds of software and coding languages. after that I took Programming 1 with Python my favorite language so far (Only one i'm good at thus far ) and finally Cyber Security that was my all time favorite class in High School it pushed me right into debugging and problem solving on both Linux And Windows. Back on track my Views are now Coding Html and Python ( Aka this website :) ) and Docker I currently own 4 server in ties with Alexander and I basically just spend alot of time with my amazing girlfriend and fix anything that breaks or need updating on Osbeorn Hosting side of things. Alexander has changed to the Tedious task person and the Manager of Basically Everything he is the backbone behind Osb Hosting he carry's the weight of people dms and management and setup of new servers I just code and update ways to make his job easier and finally Jonas. Jonas has completely switched lanes and has learned HTML he told us that hosting was not in his interests and he would rather just develop websites for us and other people which we said of course but couldn't just let him do that we made him media manager so he is the view of Osb Hosting he is what appeases the users eye and is constantly updating our website for peoples ease. Well this is where the story ends for now :) from my view ~Devon.<br>

                <p class="u-text u-text-white u-text-3">My Accomplishments... Well So far my Accomplishments and things I'm most proud of are Osbeorn Hosting and my Girlfriend oh and lets not forget my Home Lab. But honestly no one wants to hear me talk tech sorry read about me talking tech so lets not talk about Osbeorn Hosting (If you want to read about how Osb Hosting became a thing click on Who Am I / Osbeorn History. My Accomplishments.. have you ever tried to answer that its not a easy word to answer so much meaning behind it. accomplishments, I have already told you the things I'm proud of but that's not what i think that word means it might mean something else to you but for me it means the things i feel i have leaped over in my life. This is about to get deep and be a Short History of things I Feel I have leaped over lets begin. Why the 2 year wait on my Who Am I well hers is why. I was having an amazing day with my grand-dad i was in 6th grade we just got done taking off the trash to the landfill and I did not own a phone yet my parents did not want me engrossed in technology. He let me drive home my first time driving it was amazing it was an 04 Toyota Tundra a nice truck. My dad is a Mechanic our family used to own a Business doing Mechanics well that all changed that day when we got back from dropping off the trash my uncle (Different from the one that introduced me to computers) ran out to the car and told me that my dad had been in a terrible motor cycle accident and was hanging on by threads (Meaning he did not have much keeping him here) so we rushed to the Er and met my mom and brothers there. once I arrived on scene everything broke into terror my mom had to explain to her son that his dad might die and if he does will never be the same man he once was. Once she told me all of that information i blanked out my dad was my very best friend he would take side gigs at work like fixing laptops because it spiked his interest too now that i was always on them he introduced me to the mechanic side of computers. Once I came too I was being held by my brother Ross who was telling me it was going to be okay that dad was going to be okay. My dad survived a Motorcycle T-Bone crash by not a car but a Tahoe (Large SUV) He has some problems like a missing leg but other than that he is still my dad and he is still here some people don't have the ability to say that they would have loss there loved one in that accident and would be broken. Lucky I didn't it was a work of art my dad was still alive I promised god I would forever be in debt to him if my dad were to be kept on Earth I prayed every night until he was back at home. Later that month my Dog Diesel A Full blooded German Sheppard got Flat bone cancer and died within 2 weeks of being diagnosed with it by our pet hospital. I feel as tho God took Diesel as a trade for my dad and I'm okay with that that dog got me though everything that my dad was gone and not there to comfort me with. I feel as that is the greatest accomplishment in my life that I survived that trauma and hope no-one else ever has to go though what I went through its a terrible feeling and I can relate to people with that feeling somewhat. By best friend Nick Morris has had the same trauma that i went through his mom had 2 strokes back to back and she had to relearn her Motor Skills. That is why we are so close because both of us had the accident at the same time and met in 7th grade when our parents were in physical therapy trying to be them selves again to be parents to us. That is My Accomplishment whats yours? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

As of February of 2021 I have 96 Enterprise CPUS 288 gb of ECC ram and 15 TB of storage in my home lab that runs everything I have Talked about except this website we use git hub because we feel as tho we want ourselves to be remembered even where we are not here anymore. My Programming rig / Gaming rig is a Digital Storm Avon 17 with 32 GB of ram A NVIDIA 2070 Max-P GPU and a INTEL I7-9750H Processor.<br>We feel as to host our own content rather than use Amazon AWS or Google CLOUD processing or any other provider because we can say we can us being up is reliant os us as a company rather than someone that uses them. yes they never go down but whats the fun in that where is the hands in keeping the server up to date making sure HDDS are S.M.A.R.T Passing. companies now don't have to have there own servers they are just paying google to do it for them. We use our own servers because they keep our information and we can cut off and regulate out equipment how ever we want once you put something into google or amazon don't think it is going to just vanish when you click delete (Mind you we have nothing that will cause us to be worried about that) but its the case that we can just power down and cause people to be with there families on holidays rather than crammed in a bedroom setting up there server from us and all of there users not have 1 more option to keep them in there rooms. All I am saying is we host our own stuff because we want too and can and feel as tho that we are not contribution to the massive company's that have the control of the internet.&nbsp; <br>

I am able to problem solve and figure out most things that are thrown at me mind you if its something I'm incapable or doing or have not learned yet I will let you know first, secondly I'm very trust worthy and stick to my word if i say I'm going to do something I mean it with all my heart. I'm a jack of all trades I dabble in one thing learn it do some things and move on to the next thing that interests me I am only satisfied when something is always a new challenge like computers they are always changing and becoming more abundant all over the planet humans have decided to become very lazy and make more and more computers do tasks for us, i feel as tho this is going to bite us in the ass one day when our kids are never taught the fundamentals of life in school anymore like Gardening or Woodwork to restart a city or town if necessary. I'm rambling now but these are my Abilities and if this website does not give you a feel of how I am I'm sorry (NOI) but I hope you have enjoyed my talkings with you and hope you have a different view on things now. ~Devon February 2021<br>
